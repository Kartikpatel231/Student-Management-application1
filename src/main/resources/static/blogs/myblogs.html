    <p>
        1884 is the landmark year as the foundation stone was laid 138 years ago for Shri Vaishnav Group of Institutions by compassionate cloth merchants of Vaishnav cult of Indore, which was later rechristened as Shri Vaishnav Sahayak Kapada Market Committee in the year 1934.
    </p>
    <p>
        Shri Vaishnav Vidyapeeth Trust believes in taking the nation forward by improving the quality of life of its citizens by continuously working in the sphere of education, health, and the environment. It has been established to promote education and research in various disciplines through academic institutions for the benefits of all sections of the society, but not with the motive of profit.
    </p>
    <p>
        Shri Vaishnav Shekshanik Avam Parmarthik Nyas was established under the able guidance of Shri Vaishnav Sahayak Kapada Market Committee in the year 1981. Since then, Nyas has been working relentlessly for the upliftment of the society and country as a whole by providing better technical and professional education, health facilities, schools, and other services. Shri Vaishnav Sahayak Kapada Market Committee is running the following Trusts, Colleges, Schools, and Institutes of Professional Studies and Research and also rendering social service.

    <h3>Purushottamdas Pasari Chancellor</h3>
    <div id="pd1">
        <p>Born on 24th December 1948, Purushottamdas Pasari S/o. Late Shri Prahladdasji Pasari, inherited the tradition of social service, religious fervor, and work culture from his father who was devoted to educational and social activities.</p>
        <p>Purushottamdas Pasari attained academic excellence and received the degree of M.Com., L.L.B., and a diploma in Business management. He was married to Shrimati Veenadevi and has a son Ajay Pasari and a daughter Shrimati Archana Jaju. The Pasari family inherited the cloth business and has a garment manufacturing industry.</p>
        <p>Purushottamdas Pasari had to face a lot of adverse and difficult circumstances to manage Shri Vaishnav Trust and educational institutions run by the Trust. Undeterred by inimical situations and circumstances. Pasari stood like a rock and faced all kinds of unfriendly circumstances. He does selfless service and performed all duties and responsibilities given to him by the Trust. He has taken up his responsibilities with a missionary zeal.</p>
        <p>In addition to his duties to his family, Pasari has attracted the attention of the public with his selfless devotion to social and academic activities.</p>
        <p>The Pasari family has a major role in establishing Shri Vaishnav Society in Indore. After the sudden demise of his father in 1985, Purushottamdas Pasari became a trustee of Shri Vaishnav group of Trusts. He held the positions of Treasurer, Secretary, and various other key responsibilities under the banner of Shri Vaishnav group of Trusts. Taking into account the overall picture of his work, Pasari was elected Chairman of Shri Vaishnav group of Trusts on 25th February 2013. Since then, Shri Vaishnav group of Trusts has made a name in academia and social service. Pasari’s contribution in these fields is laudable.</p>
